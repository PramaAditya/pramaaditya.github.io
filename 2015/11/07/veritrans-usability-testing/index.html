				<p>This is an english translation of the same article I wrote in Indonesia
<a href="https://medium.com/@vranbor/usability-testing-pada-layanan-vt-link-milik-veritrans-6a547e793dc5">here</a></p>

<p>Veritrans burst the scene in Indonesia with the vision to be the pioneer of UX
Payment in Indonesia. But a quick usability test shows that people run into some
critical issues with Veritrans VT-Link feature.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>

<p>Identify the pain points that users encounter in making a VT-Link.</p>

<h3 id="test-parameters">Test Parameters</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What:</strong> Veritrans’ Website and Merchant Administration Portal (MAP)</li>
  <li><strong>Who:</strong> 4 Social media (Facebook, Instagram and LINE) merchants aged 22–50</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>

<p>Users were asked to the these tasks that’s been made into scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the name and information of VT-Link service (the name won’t be mentioned
beforehand)</li>
  <li>Fill the required information to start using VT-Link for real</li>
  <li>Make 1 VT-Link for an item and another VT-Link for a bundle (multiple items)</li>
</ol>

<p>Example of the scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A new supply of Ghosty Comic Vol. 1 just arrived, and you just saw a link for an
online payment, powered by Veritrans.</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="image-caption">Example of a VT-Link in an Instagram post</span>

</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>You want to use the same service to sell the new batch of comic in your Facebook
Page. Find the name and information about that service in Veritrans’ website.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="processing">Processing</h3>

<p>I documented every complain and feedback in Trello, I also marked complains and
feedback that came from multiple users.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">

<span class="image-caption">Issues are categorised by similarities. In each category, the issues are sorted
by frequency. Categories are also sorted by frequency</span>
</div>

<h3 id="issues-found">Issues Found</h3>

<h4 id="website">Website</h4>

<p><strong>Users don’t know the requirement to start using VT-Link for receiving
payment</strong></p>

<p>After browsing the website for several minutes to gain informations, users
assumed they only need their ID Card to start receiving payment via Veritrans.
Only a couple users felt that they need NPWP (Tax) and SIUP. This happens
because users can’t find the information about it while browsing the website.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The requirement should be put up front, when I was signing up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No user read the “how to integrate with Veritrans” section in Products and
Pricing page</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xHD5MxGd-EprXWgQLiM-nw.png" />
<span class="image-caption">No user read this part in detail</span>

</div>

<p>Veritrans actually specify the said requirements in their support page. But
unfortunately there’s no obvious link for user to get to that page. The only
link I found is the FAQ link in the footer.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VPez4Nea7S9cMjAf9ju6Eg.png" />
<span class="image-caption">The FAQ/Support page that contain crucial informations can only be accessed
in the footer (Help section)</span>
</div>

<p>I assume Veritrans is reluctant to put the requirements in the home page in fear
it would discourage new user to try using Veritrans. But making users navigate
their way to these requirements in MAP only makes them frustrated and some even
felt cheated, because of the promise of ease of use.</p>

<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Add a link to the support page in the Navigation Bar and
somewhere in the homepage. A page as important as that should be easily accessed
by users</p>

<h4 id="sandbox">Sandbox</h4>

<p><strong>Users were confused by the presence of sample data in MAP, users also had a
hard time to change the environment to Production</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m confused. What’s the different between Sandbox and Production?” said a user
even after he successfully change environment back and forth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After users signed up and opened the MAP, users were put in the Sandbox
environment. With Sandbox, users are expected to try features that’s made
available by Veritrans.</p>

<p>But the sample data didn’t immediately show up. Only after users open other
pages, the data suddenly appears. It seems that there’re some sort of delay.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*y8EVB16s83fHUoFavrTd2A.png" />
<span class="image-caption">When new users first logged in to MAP, there was no sample data</span>

</div>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*tg-KbVe85RPvLZjXlgX2YA.png" />
</div>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Fl_NONKtL9vBZccnaReH5Q.png" />
<span class="image-caption">But after opening another page, the sample data appeared out of nowhere. This
made the users confused</span>
</div>

<p>Even until the end of test, users were still unsure what do Sandbox and
Production mean. Some suggested to change the names.</p>

<p>The lack of onboarding tutorial and more importantly a delay in sample data
emergence make the users confused. Users failed to make a connection between
Sandbox = Testing because of the delay in sample data. This may also contributed
to why users were unsure what’s the meaning of Sandbox and Production, even
after they successfully changed environment.</p>

<p>Some users were aware of the colour scheme change when they switch environments
(Sandbox = light blue, Production = dark blue). But some users thought the
colour change was due to somethings else.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ppmITjzf2XN4BX3_aTgK4w.png" />
<span class="image-caption">This dropdown to switch environment isn’t visible enough for the users</span>

</div>

<p>After I told the users that Sandbox means they were in testing mode, users were
asked to change the environment to Production. Some users looked in Settings
menu. Only one user intuitively choose the dropdown next to the merchant’s name.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ByPx_L9xTqys8dg1OyPJYQ.png" />
<span class="image-caption">No users switched environment this way</span>

</div>

<p>No users switched environment via the dropdown menu in the upper right hand side
(User logo).</p>

<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Users need to know that they’re currently in sandbox
environment that is intended to be tinkered with. Make a more aggressive
signifier. Try to change the name of the environments to something that’d be
more intuitive for the user. The sample data must also appears instantaneously,
with no delay.</p>

<h4 id="vt-link">VT-Link</h4>

<p>Most users didn’t encounter any problem while making VT-Links. But when they
open the URL they just made, users were confused what page were they seeing.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PCMCSMwSjhD--G-9CQ_LLA.png" />
<span class="image-caption">Most users were confused by this page functionality</span>

</div>

<p>They didn’t realize that the page they opened was a payment page, they also
didn’t realize that payment methods were missing.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bHPTx1vqHQ-DC59h2pPZjg.png" />
<span class="image-caption">Users didn’t realize the absence of payment methods in the VT-Link they made.</span>
</div>

<p>Users felt the need of an indicator that states the function of the page, and an
indicator about the absence of payment methods.</p>

<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Users need to know that the URL they just opened is a
live/active payment page, users must also know that there’s no payment method
available yet, and why.</p>

<h4 id="complete-merchant-registration">Complete Merchant Registration</h4>

<p>Even After knowing there was no available payment methods yet, user had no idea
why. Only after I told them it was because their data was incomplete they start
looking where they can fill it.</p>

<p>Every user went and looked in the Settings sub-menus. Only after several minutes
of searching that they clicked on the notification button in the upper left
corner.</p>

<span class="image-caption">Users didn’t realise the notification “Please complete your registration here”
was clickable</span>
</div>

<p>Although user saw the notification that their registration is not complete, no
user immediately clicked on the text. Only after they hovered their cursor on
the text that they realized it was clickable. There’s no signifier that the
notification can be clicked.</p>

<span class="image-caption">Default notification in the Sandbox environment</span>

</div>

<p>Some users said that they don’t bother to open the notification (in Production
environment) because there was also a (different) notification in the Sandbox.
They thought it was just the same notification so they don’t try to open it.</p>

<p>After clicking the notification, a pop up title “Complete Merchant Registration
appeared.</p>

<span class="image-caption">Complete Merchant Registration pop up</span>

</div>

<p>There’s 3 sections that users said they can’t find anywhere else. Those were
Corporate Information, Business Detail and IT Information.</p>

<p>After filling every information, users were shown the list of documents that’s
needed to be sent (by email) to Veritrans for them to start selling:</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UFdpxaOjCrMElzuIr8QHPA.png" />
<span class="image-caption">List of the required documents, shown after users filled their informations in
the pop up</span>
</div>

<p>Every user assumed that every single one of the document have to be sent for
them to start using Veritrans. Therefore every user felt the requirements was
too demanding for them.</p>

<p>One user felt irritated that they only know these requirements after they went
to so much trouble to navigate the MAP, he felt that those requirements should
be told to him much earlier in the process, as early as he was signing up.</p>

<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong> No user intuitively open the notification in the top-right
corner to complete their registration, most users try to look in the Settings
sub-menus. Hence make the Corporate Information, Business Detail and IT
Information form available in the Settings sub menus. It’d even better to group
all of the form together in Settings. Also, separate the required documents for
individuals and corporate, don’t join them together, so individuals don’t feel
discouraged by the requirements.</p>

<h3 id="design-suggestion">Design Suggestion</h3>

<p>Because many users were confused with the term environment and Sandbox, I
propose to change their name to <strong>Testing Mode</strong> (and <strong>Production Mode</strong>). I’d
refrain from also changing the Production name, so the current users don’t get
confused by the names.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Wj3bm9RS51uOJ-6vI89r-g.png" />
</div>

<p>I’d also propose a change from dropdown to toggle buttons. This has 2 effects.
First, it let current users notice that Sandbox have been changed to Testing.
Second, it let new users see the available modes right away.</p>

<p>There’s also a warning bar that acts as a signifier that the user is currently
navigating in Testing mode. This warning bar will keep appearing as long as the
user is in the Testing mode.</p>

<p>There were no signifier that the notification can be clicked in the sidebar,
hence some visual hierarchy and borders can be used to signify that it’s
clickable</p>

<h4 id="make-boundaries">Make Boundaries</h4>

<p>Sandbox is a step to a right direction for Veritrans, it enables users to tinker
with MAP while making sure no real data is being used. But MAP doesn’t have any
anti-affordance to prevent user from using the Production environment without
first completing their registration. Without this boundary it was possible for
user making a VT-Link with no payment methods.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PCMCSMwSjhD--G-9CQ_LLA.png" />
<span class="image-caption">Anti affordance is used to prevent user making a blank VT-Link/VT-Web like this</span>
</div>

<p>This boundary should also be made to prevent users feeling overwhelmed when they
first used MAP. With user restricted to Testing Mode, they can explore the
features freely without accidentally switching to Production.</p>

<p>I propose a modal informing the user that they’ve switched to Production Mode
and to proceed they must complete their registration. In the modal there’s 2
buttons, the first button leads to the Complete Merchant Registration page while
the other buttons will switch the environment back to Testing mode. The latter
button is useful if the user switched to Production accidentally.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4oduJ-fA4ckSLcnKTwrsTQ.png" />
<span class="image-caption">Modal as both an anti-affordance and signifier when user try using the
Production Mode</span>
</div>

<p>This modal functions as an anti-affordance that prevent the user from using
Production Mode while their information aren’t complete and as a signifier that
their information aren’t complete.</p>

<p>This modal can’t be closed and will always appear as long as their registration
and required documents aren’t completed. Only after Veritrans received the
required documents and activated their account, can the user start using
Production Mode.</p>

<span class="image-caption">User will receive notification when their account is activated, enabling them to
use Production Mode</span>
</div>

<h4 id="vt-link--vt-web">VT-Link / VT-Web</h4>

<p>Lastly, I’d also suggest adding some more clarity in the VT-Link (and/or VT-Web)
page by adding a “Payment Details” title and and indicator about the lack of
payment method activated by the merchant</p>

<p>Veritrans has a vision to be the number 1 UX payment company in Indonesia. By
implementing my suggestions hopefully the user experience, especially the
merchants can be enhanced furthermore.</p>
